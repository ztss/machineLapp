1.4.1 Parametirc vs non-parametirc models
    1.Parametirc model:This models have a fixed number of parameters.
    2.Non-parametirc model:The numebr of parameters grow with the amount of
      training data.
    3.Compare:Parametric models have the advantage of often being faster to
      use,but the disadvantage of making stronger assumptions about the nature
      of the data distributions.Non-parametirc models are more flexible,but
      often computationally intractable for large datasets.
